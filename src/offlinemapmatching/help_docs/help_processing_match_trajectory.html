        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Network-Layer:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">This combobox shows all layers of the current QGIS project with the geometry type LINESTRING/MULTILINESTRING. The network, needed to match the trajectory on it, shall be selected. It is recommended, that this layer should be a clean graph following a node-edge-model, i.e. different lines should only touch other lines, never cross them.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Trajectory-Layer:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The combobox shows all layers of the current QGIS project with the geometry type POINT/MULTIPOINT. The trajectory, which will be matched with the network, shall be selected.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Trajectory-ID:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The combobox shows all fields of the chosen trajectory layer. The selected field will be added to the result features, so that the vertices of the result layer can be referred to the points of the trajectory.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Maximum Search Distance [m]:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">The maximum distance to find points on the network for each trajectory point. It is mandatory, that this value is greater oder equal than the highest shortest distance between all trajectory points and the whole network. This setting has a big influence on the computing time. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/jagodki/Offline-MapMatching">repository on GitHub</a> for further information about it.</font></p>
        <h4><font face="helvetica, arial">Matching Type:</font></h4>
        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">Two matching types are available. The slower type uses a routing between candidates to calculate the distance of the shortes route between them. The faster type just calculates the euklidean distance of the beeline between the candidates. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/jagodki/Offline-MapMatching">repository on GitHub</a> for additonal information about this setting.</font></p>

        <p><font size=3 face="helvetica, arial">A detailed description about the algorithm is provided in the <a href="https://github.com/jagodki/Offline-MapMatching">README document</a> of the project on GitHub.</font></p>
